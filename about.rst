Hi! My name is Ben, and this is my website!

I work as a research software engineer for the `Biodiversity Institute`_
at the `University of Kansas`_. As the lead developer of `Specify 7`_,
I work primarily with Python and Javascript. I also deal extensively
with MySQL and HTML5/CSS, though I am accomplished in neither web
design nor DBA. Specify 7 is the web based incarnation of the
venerable `Specify`_ family of collection databasing software.

All opinions on this site are my own
and do not reflect the views of my employer.

I have lived in Lawrence, KS since 2002 when I came to graduate school
at KU to study physics. I grew up in Southwest Missouri near
Springfield.
